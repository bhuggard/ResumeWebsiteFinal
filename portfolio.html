              <p>
                Using wearable tech solutions, I work in real time with players, coaches, and trainers
                to help ensure high quality practices and load management for our athletes over the course
                of the season. Working end to end from data collection and cleaning to visualization and presentation,
                I've helped optimize practice plans and player rotations throughout the season.

              <p>
                Stepping into a business intelligence role with iSPORTiSTICS,
                I was tasked with cleaning a database of over 500 contacts. Using Python and Excel I was able to re-format
                previously messy information to a point where it could be uploaded to HubSpot CRM Management. Once that was done, I used HubSpot to create
                email based marketing campaigns to maintain contact with potential clients.

            <p>
              Working with a group of students at the University of Michigan, I'm leading an effort to create a new
              solution for people looking to play common party games at college. Saving the cost of needing to buy a table and design supplies, Tipsy Tables Tops
              provides students with the ability to put a creative design on a product designed to turn any raised surface into a perfect place for college games!

            <h3>Wolverine Focus</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            College students are often overworked and deprived of sleep. Too many times I've seen students resort to things like
            Adderall or Vyvanse when its not prescribed out of sheer desperation. It's an epidemic I aim to solve; using clinically tested and FDA 
            approved supplements, Wolverine Focus will allow students to find ways to maximize their academic output without endargering themselves
            by reaching for drugs not prescribed to them.
